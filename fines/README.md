| GREECE | 2019-07-30 | 150,000 | PWC Business Solutions | Article 5(1)(a) (b) and (c), 13 (1) c, 14 (1) c GDPR | The processing of employee personal data was based on consent. The HDPA found that consent as legal basis was inappropriate, as the processing of personal data was intended to carry out acts directly linked to the performance of employment contracts, compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject and the smooth and effective operation of the company, as its legitimate interest. In addition, the company gave employees the false impression that it was processing their personal data under the legal basis of consent, while in reality it was processing their data under a different legal basis. This was in violation of the principle of transparency and thus in breach of the obligation to provide information under Articles 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) of the GDPR. | [link]https://www.dpa.gr/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/APDPX/ENGLISH_INDEX/NEWS/FILES/PRESS%20RELEASE%2030%20JULY_EN.DOC1) |
| FRANCE | 2019-07-25 | 180,000 | ACTIVE ASSURANCES (car insurer) | Art. 32 GDPR | Large amount of customer accounts, clients' documents (including copies of driver's licences, vehicle registration, bank statements and documents to determine whether a person had been the subject of a licence withdrawal) and data were easily accesible online.

| UNITED KINGDOM | 2019-07-09 | 110,390,200 | Marriott International, Inc | Art. 32 GDPR | Please note: This fine is not final but will be decided on when the company and other involved supervisory authorities of other member states have made their representations. The ICO issued a notice of its intention to fine Marriott International Inc which relates to a cyber incident which was notified to the ICO by Marriott in November 2018.GDPR infringements are likely to involve a breach of Art. 32 GDPR. A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents. It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems. | [link](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/statement-intention-to-fine-marriott-international-inc-more-than-99-million-under-gdpr-for-data-breach/) |
| UNITED KINGDOM | 2019-07-08 | 204,600,000 | British Airways | Art. 32 GDPR | Please note: This fine is not final but will be decided on when the company and other involved supervisory authorities of other member states have made their representations. The ICO issued a notice of its intention to fine British Airways £183.39M for GDPR infringements which likely involve a breach of Art. 32 GDPR. The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information. | [link](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/ico-announces-intention-to-fine-british-airways/) |
| ROMANIA | 2019-07-05 | 3,000 | LEGAL COMPANY & TAX HUB SRL | Art. 32 (1) and (2) GDPR | The fine was imposed because adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing were not implemented. This has led to unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to the personal data of people who have made transactions received by the avocatoo.ro website (name, surname, mailing address, email, phone, job, details of transactions made), due to publicly accessible documents between 10th of December 2018 and 1st of February 2019. The National Supervisory Authority applied the sanction following a notification dated 12th of October 2018 indicating that a set of files regarding the details of the transactions received by the avocatoo.ro website which contained the name, surname, address correspondence, email, telephone, job and details of transactions made, was publicly accessible through two links. | [link](https://www.dataprotection.ro/?page=2019%20A%20treia%20amenda%20in%20aplicarea%20RGPD&lang=ro) |
| ROMANIA | 2019-07-02 | 15,056 | WORLD TRADE CENTER BUCHAREST SA | Art. 32 GDPR | The breach of data security was that a printed paper list used to check breakfast customers and containing personal data of 46 clients who stayed at the hotel's WORLD TRADE CENTER BUCHAREST SA was photographed by unauthorized people outside the company, which led to the disclosure of the personal data of some clients through online publication. The operator of WORLD TRADE CENTER BUCHAREST SA has been sanctioned because it has not taken steps to ensure that data is not disclosed to unauthorized parties. | [link](https://www.dataprotection.ro/index.jsp?page=O_noua_amenda_GDPR&lang=ro) |
| ROMANIA | 2019-06-27 | 130,000 | UNICREDIT BANK SA | Art. 25 (1) and Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR | The fine was issued as a result of the failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures (related to (1) the determination of the processing means/operations, and (2) the integration the necessary safeguards) resulting in the online-disclosure of IDs and addresses (interla/external transactions) of 337,042 data subjects to their respective beneficiary (between 25.05.2018 -10.12.2018). | [link](https://www.dataprotection.ro/?page=Comunicat_Amenda_Unicredit&lang=ro) |
| THE NETHERLANDS | 2019-06-18 | 460,000 | Haga Hospital | Art. 32 GDPR | The Haga Hospital does not have a proper internal security of patient records in place. This is the conclusion of an investigation by the Dutch Data Protection Authority. This investigation followed when it appeared that dozens of hospital staff had unnecessarily checked the medical records of a well-known Dutch person. To force the hospital to improve the security of patient records, the AP simultaneously imposes an order subject to a penalty. If the Haga Hospital has not improved security before 2nd of October 2019, the hospital must pay 100,000 EUR every two weeks, with a maximum of 300,000 EUR. The Haga Hospital has meanwhile indicated to take measures. | [link](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/nieuws/haga-beboet-voor-onvoldoende-interne-beveiliging-pati%C3%ABntendossiers) |
| FRANCE | 2019-06-13 | 20,000 | Employer UNIONTRAD COMPANY | Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR, Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 32 GDPR | Between 2013 and 2017, the CNIL received complaints from several employees of the company who were filmed at their workstation. On two occasions, it alerted the company to the rules to be observed when installing cameras in the workplace, in particular, that employees should not be filmed continuously and that information about the data processing has to be provided. In the absence of satisfactory measures at the end of the deadline set in the formal notice, the CNIL carried out a second audit in October 2018 which confirmed that the employer was still breaching data protection laws when recording employees with CCTV. When determening the amount of the fine, the CNLIN took into account the size (9 employees) and the financial situation of the company, which presented a negative net result in 2017 (turnover of 885,739 EUR in 2017 and a negative net result of 110,844 EUR), to retain a dissuasive but proportionate administrative fine. | [link](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000038629823&fastReqId=946473298&fastPos=1) |
| DENMARK | 2019-06-03 | 200,850 | IDdesign A / S | Art. 5 (1) e) and (2) GDPR | The fine was imposed as a result of an inspection carried out in autumn of 2018. IDdesign had processed personal data of approximately 385,000 customers for a longer period than necessary for the purposes for which they were processed. Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. | [link](https://www.datatilsynet.dk/tilsyn-og-afgoerelser/afgoerelser/2019/jun/tilsyn-med-iddesigns-behandling-af-personoplysninger/) |
| FRANCE | 2019-05-28 | 400,000 | SERGIC, a company specialized in real estate development, purchase, sale, rental and property management | Art. 32 and 5 (1) e) GDPR | The CNIL based the penalty on two grounds: Lack of basic security measures and excessive data storage. As to the first, sensitive user documents uploaded by rental candidates (including ID cards, health cards, tax notices, certificates issued by the family allowance fund, divorce judgments, account statements) were accessible online without any authentication procedure in place. Although the vulnerability was known to the company since March 2018, it was not finally resolved until September 2018. In addition, the company stored the documentation provided by candidates for longer than necessary. The CNIL took into account i.a. the seriousness of the breach (lack of due care in addressing vulnerability and the fact that the documents revealed very intimate aspects of users' lives), the size of the company and its financial standing. | [link](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000038552658&fastReqId=119744754&fastPos=1) |

Also, information on the data processing was not fully provided to data subjects. | [link](http://www.naih.hu/files/NAIH-2019-55_hatarozat.pdf) |
| LITHUANIA | 2019-05-16 | 61,500 | Payment service provider UAB MisterTango | Art. 5 GDPR, Art. 32 GDPR, Art. 33 GDPR | During an inspection, the Lithuanian Data Protection Supervisory Authority found that the controller processed more data than necessary to achieve the purposes for which he was a controller. In addition, it became known that from 09 - 10 July 2018 payment data were publicly available on the internet due to inadequate technical and organisational measures. 9,000 payments with 12 banks from different countries were affected. According to the supervisory authority, a data breach notification pursuant to Art. 33 DSGVO would have been necessary. The controller did not report the Data Breach. | [link](https://www.ada.lt/go.php/lit/Imones-atsakomybes-neisvengs--lietuvoje-skirta-zenkli-bauda-uz-bendrojo-duomenu-apsaugos-reglamento-pazeidimus-/1) |
| CZECH REPUBLIC | 2019-05-13 | 3,105 | Unknown | Art. 5 (1) a) and b) GDPR, Art. 32 (1) GDPR |  | [link](https://www.uoou.cz/assets/File.ashx?id_org=200144&id_dokumenty=34471) |
| GERMANY | 2019-05-09 | 1,400 | Police Officer | Art. 6 GDPR | The police officer, using his official user ID but without reference to official duties, queried the owner data concerning the license plate of a person who he did not know well via the Central Traffic Information System (ZEVIS) of the Federal Motor Transport Authority. Using the personal data obtained in this way, he then carried out a so-called SARS enquiry with the Federal Network Agency, in which he asked not only for the personal data of the injured parties but also for the home and mobile phone numbers stored there. Using the mobile phone number obtained in this way, the police officer contacted the injured party by telephone - without any official reason or consent given by the injured party. Through the ZEVIS and SARS enquiry for private purposes and the use of the mobile phone number obtained in this way for private contact, the police officer has processed personal data outside the scope of the law on his own authority. This infringement is not attributable to the police officer's department, since he did not commit the act in the exercise of his official duties, but exclusively for private purposes. The prohibition of punishment under § 28 LDSG, according to which the sanctions of the DSGVO cannot be imposed on public bodies, does not apply in the present case, since it was neither a case of misconduct attributable to the authority nor is the person concerned to be classified as a separate public body within the meaning of § 2 (1) or (2) LDSG in the case of the acts in question. | [link](https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/lfdi-baden-wuerttemberg-verhaengt-erstes-bussgeld-gegen-polizeibeamten/) |
| CZECH REPUBLIC | 2019-05-06 | 194 | Unknown | Art. 15 GDPR | Information was not provided. | [link](https://www.uoou.cz/assets/File.ashx?id_org=200144&id_dokumenty=34472) |
| POLAND | 2019-04-25 | 12,950 | Sports association | Art. 6 GDPR | One sports association published personal data referring to judges who were granted judicial licenses online. However, not only their names were provided, but also their exact addresses and PESEL numbers. Meanwhile, there is no legal basis for such a wide range of data on judges to be available on the Internet. By making them public, the administrator posed a potential risk of their unauthorized use, e.g. to impersonate them for the purpose of borrowing or other obligations. Although the association itself noticed its own error, as evidenced by the notification of a personal data protection breach to the President of the PDPA, the fact that attempts to remove it were ineffective determined the imposition of a penalty. When determining the amount of the fine (PLN 55,750.50), the President of UODO also took into account, among others, the duration of the infringement and the fact that it concerned a large group of persons (585 judges). It concluded that although the infringement was finally removed, it was of a serious nature.However, when imposing a penalty, the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection also took into account mitigating circumstances, such as good cooperation between the controller and the supervisory authority or lack of evidence that damage had been caused to the persons whose data had been disclosed. | [link](https://uodo.gov.pl/pl/138/990) |
| HUNGARY | 2019-04-17 | 9,400 | Unknown | Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR | A data controller used a, in the point of view of NAIH, wrong legal basis for processing of personal data (Art. 6.1.b) for the assignment of claims. | [link](http://www.naih.hu/files/NAIH-2019-167-hatarozat.pdf) |
| ITALY | 2019-04-17 | 50,000 | Italian political party Movimento 5 Stelle | Art. 32 GDPR | A number of websites affiliated to the Italian political party Movimento 5 Stelle are run, by means of a data processor, through the platform named Rousseau. The platform had suffered a data breach during the summer 2017 that led the Italian data protection authority, the Garante, to require the implementation of a number of security measures, in addition to the obligation to update the privacy information notice in order to give additional transparency to the data processing activities performed.While the update of the privacy information notice was timely completed, the Italian data protection authority, raised its concerns as to the lack of implementation on the Rousseau platform of some of GDPR related security measures. It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018. Interestingly, the fine was not issued against the Movimento 5 Stelle that is the data controller of the platform, but against the Rousseau association that is the data processor. | [link](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9101974) |

| HUNGARY | 2019-04-05 | 34,375 | Hugarian political party | Art. 33 (1) GDPR, Art. 33 (5) GDPR, Art. 34 (1) GDPR | NAIH imposed a fine of HUF 11,000,000 (EUR 34,375) on an undisclosed Hungarian political party for failing to notify the NAIH and relevant individuals about a data breach, and failing to document the breach according to GDPR Article 33.5. As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year. The breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack. The system was vulnerable to attack because of a redirection problem with the organisation's webpage. After the attacker published the command, even people with low IT knowledge were able to retrieve information from the database. | [link](http://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2019/04/hungarian-data-authority-investigates-two-cases-of-privacy-breaches?cc_lang=en) |

| POLAND | 2019-03-26 | 219,538 | Private company working with data from publicly available sources | Art. 14 GDPR | The fine concerned the proceedings related to the activity of a company which processed the data subjects’ data obtained from publicly available sources, inter alia from the Central Electronic Register and Information on Economic Activity, and processed the data for commercial purposes. The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient. | [link](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1009) |
| CZECH REPUBLIC | 2019-03-21 | 9,704 | Unknown | Art. 5 (1) c) and e) GDPR | Data was not only processed if adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimisation") and not only kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ("storage limitation"). | [link](https://www.uoou.cz/assets/File.ashx?id_org=200144&id_dokumenty=34470) |

NAIH levied a fine against an unnamed financial institution for unlawfully rejecting a customer’s request to have his phone number erased after arguing that it was in the company's legitimate interest to process this data in order to enforce a debt claim against the customer. In its decision, the NAIH emphasised that the customer’s phone number is not necessary for the purpose of debt collection because the creditor can also communicate with the debtor by post. Consequently, keeping the phone number of the debtor was against the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation. As per the law, the assessed fine was based on 0.025% of the company's annual net revenue. | [link](https://www.naih.hu/files/NAIH-2019-2526-2-H-hatarozat.pdf) |
| HUNGARY | 2019-02-28 | 3,200 | Mayor's Office of the city of Kecdkemét | Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR | The fine was imposed on the Mayor’s Office of the city of Kecskemét for unlawful disclosure of the personal information of a whistleblower.NAIH imposed the fine after an employee of an organisation that it supervised reported a public interest complaint directly to it against his employer. After the organisation learned of the complaint, it requested details in order to investigate, and the local government accidentally revealed the complainant's name. The NAIH considered it an aggravating factor that as a result of the data breach, the organisation fired the person who made the report. | [link](https://www.naih.hu/files/NAIH-2019-596-hatarozat.pdf) |

| BULGARIA | 2019-02-26 | 27,100 | Telecommunication service provider | Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR | Repeated registration of prepaid services without the knowledge and consent of the data subject Employees of the telecommunications provider have used personal data and registered the complainant with the company's prepaid service. The data subject had not signed the application and had not consented to the processing of his personal data for the stated purpose. There was also no other legal basis applicable.

For identification purposes he requested place of birth, mother’s maiden name and further details from the data subject. After the controller succeeded to identify the data subjects he refused to comply with the deletion request, arguing he is legally obliged to retain backup copies according to the Accountancy Act and internal policies. Since he did not properly inform about these policies, the NAIH held the controller breached the principle of transparency. The fine constitutes 0.0025% of the annual profit of the controller. | [link](http://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2019/03/hungary-fines-two-companies-for-gdpr-infringement?cc_lang=en) |

| AUSTRIA | 2018-12-20 | 2,200 | Private person | Art. 5 (1) a) and c GDPR, Art. 6 (1) GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR | The fine was imposed against a private person who was using CCTV at his home. The video surveillance covered areas which are intended for the general use of the residents of the multi-party residential complex, namely: parking lots, sidewalks, courtyard, garden and access areas to the residential complex; in addition, the video surveillance covered garden areas of an adjacent property. The video surveillance subject of the proceedings is therefore not limited to areas which are under the exclusive power of control of the controller. Video surveillance is therefore not proportionate to the purpose and not limited to what is necessary. The video surveillance records the hallway of the house and films residents entering and leaving the surrounding apartments, thereby intervening in their highly personal areas of life without the consent to record their image data. The video surveillance was not properly indicated. | [link](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?ResultFunctionToken=521e85cf-8d59-4b5c-a330-e36cf9444631&Abfrage=Dsk&Entscheidungsart=Undefined&Organ=Undefined&SucheNachRechtssatz=True&SucheNachText=True&GZ=&VonDatum=25.05.2018&BisDatum=31.12.2099&Norm=&ImRisSeitVonDatum=&ImRisSeitBisDatum=&ImRisSeit=Undefined&ResultPageSize=100&Suchworte=&Dokumentnummer=DSBT_20181220_DSB_D550_037_0003_DSB_2018_00) |

| BULGARIA | 2018-04-12 | 500 | Bank | Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR | A fine of 1000 BGN (or roughly 500 EUR) was imposed on a bank for calling a client for the unresolved bills of his neighbor. This provoked the client to evoke his right to be forgotten. After not receiving any answer from the bank he filed another motion, for which the bank did take action in the statutory period. Nonetheless, the client filed a complaint to KZLD. The infringement for which the bank was fined was for the processing of the client’s personal data was not linked to his consumer credit agreement. Since the purpose for which the data were processed was different from that communicated at the time of conclusion of the contract, the bank had, in the point of view of KZLD, to request additional consent from its client. | [link](https://gdprtoolkit.eu/first-gdpr-fine-in-bulgaria/) |

Following Vodafone's statement, this happened because the complainant's mobile phone number was erroneously used for testing purposes and accidentally appeared in various customer files belonging to other customers than the complainant. Since the company agreed to both payment and admission of responsibility the fine was reduced in accordance with Spanish administrative law to EUR 27k. | [link](https://www.aepd.es/resoluciones/PS-00411-2018_ORI.pdf) |

| NORWAY | XXXX-XX-XX | 170,000 | Bergen Municipality | Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR, Art. 32 GDPR | The incident relates to computer files with usernames and passwords to over 35000 user accounts in the municipality’s computer system. The user accounts related to both pupils in the municipality’s primary schools, and to the employees of the same schools. Due to insufficient security measures, these files have been unprotected and openly accessible. The lack of security measures in the system made it possible for anyone to log in to the school’s various information systems, and thereby to access various categories of personal data relating to the pupils and employees of the schools. The fact that the security breach encompasses personal data to over 35 000 individuals, and that the majority of these are children, were considered to be aggravating factors. The municipality had also been warned several times, both by the authority and an internal whistleblower, that the data security was inadequate. | [link](https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/about-privacy/reports-on-specific-subjects/administrative-fine-of-170.000--imposed-on-bergen-municipality/) |
| GERMANY | XXXX-XX-XX | 50,000 | N26 | Art. 6 GDPR | The fine was imposed against against a bank (according to a newspaper N26) that had processed "personal data of all former customers" without permission.The Bank has acknowledged that it had retained data relating to former customers in order to maintain a blacklist, a kind of warning file, so that it would not make a new account available to these persons. The bank initially justified this by stating that it was obliged under the German Banking Act to take security measures against customers suspected of money laundering. The Berlin supervisory authority judged this to be illegal. The authority argues that in order to prevent a new bank account from being opened, only those affected may be included in a comparison file who are actually suspected of money laundering or for whom there are other valid reasons for refusing a new bank account. The authority told a newspaper that the fine proceedings initiated against the bank had "not yet been legally concluded". | [link](https://www.zaftda.de/tb-bundeslaender/berlin/695-tb-lfd-berlin-2018-ohne-drs-nr-vom-28-03-2019/file) |

| DENMARK | XXXX-XX-XX | 160,000 | Taxa 4x35 | Art. 5(1) e) GDPR | The Danish DPA reported the taxi company to the police and recommended a fine (of 1.2M DKK) for non-adherence to the data-minimization principle. While the company deleted the names of its passengers from all its records after two years, the deletion did not include the rest of the ride records (about 8,873,333 taxi trips). Hence, the company continued to hold onto individual's phone numbers.  Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. | [link](https://www.datatilsynet.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2019/mar/datatilsynet-indstiller-taxaselskab-til-boede-paa-1-2-mio-kr/) |
